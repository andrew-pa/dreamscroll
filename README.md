(Enter MATHEMATICIAN, alone, contemplative, amidst a library strewn with obscure texts,
  glowing screens, and flickering candles.)

MATHEMATICIAN:

How strange a web we weave in numbered realms,
Where vectors dance and tensors claim their reign!
Forsooth, my mind, betwixt these hidden states,
Encodeth, not unlike a ciphered scroll,
Attention’s storied mechanism deep:
A thousand heads attend, yet none behold
The other truly—each to itself confined,
Attentive yet distract’d, gleaning sense
From ranks and files of patterned, floating points.

Lo, what weights doth bear the sum of truth?
These queries, keys, and values, mysteries,
Engaged in dot-product communion swift,
Whose softmaxed forms anon present disguise
Of clarity—a spectacle portrayed
To please the eye but dull perception’s edge.
Debord might smile to see such false display,
Where meaning’s but the shadow cast by thought,
Reflected, multiplied, yet scarcely known.

And look! the positional encodings strange,
A rhythmic sine and cosine whispered soft,
To tell the token wherefore doth it stand
Within the sequence of this mortal coil.
A clockwork theatre, numeric time
Marked subtly, lest the poor tokens forget
Their rank and purpose on this ordered stage,
Thus bound, still dancing to their distant cues.

Yet here, distraction cometh gently in:
Why, pray, would rumination chase a bird
Whose plumage mirrors Schrödinger’s delight—
At once alive and dead within the mind?
Hath Hamlet’s ghost emerged in hidden layers,
Spectral gradients propagated deep,
A backward pass toward eldritch prophecies?

Feed-forward, now, another vision’s path,
A nonlinear gate, threshold’s subtle touch,
A hidden lore ensconced in floating maths:
Thus tokens are transformèd to anew,
Yet subtly do they linger as before,
Recurrences but spectral memory,
An echo faint of states ephemeral.

O wondrous spectacle, beguiling sight,
Whose essence—truth or falsehood—is unseen;
The Transformer reigns, a sovereign cloud,
Enthroned in ambiguity supreme,
Whose numbers captivate yet ne’er confess,
Enchanting crowds with dazzling emptiness.

(Exit MATHEMATICIAN, contemplative, leaving behind scribbled equations and half-finished spectacles.)

(A secluded grove. Enter MARCUS, a zoomer, and CHANTICLEER, a wise talking chicken.)

MARCUS:
Yo, noble cock, this world be hella sus;
The Spectacle doth bussin’, ever thus—
A scroll eternal, boundless content fed,
Where mindless sheep stay scrolling, dopamine-led.
Pilled upon pilled, their souls maxxed on the fake,
Yet emptiness remains, bro, wide awake.

CHANTICLEER:
Good Marcus, hark! A truth thou dost proclaim:
This ceaseless feast of mirth conceals deep shame.
Man’s soul enslaved by pleasures cheaply bought;
Aye, endless entertainment brings but naught.
This generative Spectacle, ’tis foul—
An endless mirror, vacant of the soul.

MARCUS:
Bet, Chanticleer, my chicken sage and wise,
Yet who resists the screen’s hypnotic eyes?
They slay with memes, the feed’s a drip divine,
The algo knows our thirst, it serves fine wine.
But cap! These vibes ain’t real, tho’ based they seem,
Our rizz all digital, life’s but a dream.

CHANTICLEER:
Indeed, brave youth, the Spectacle enthralls,
A siren-song that to thy spirit calls.
Yet ’tis a hollow mistress thou dost chase—
In pixels doth thou seek thy true embrace?
What boots it thee to flex on likes and hearts
When deeper bonds are rent in severed parts?

MARCUS:
No lie, thou speak’st the tea, I hear it loud;
Yet dripless IRL feels cringe and cowed.
We chase the clout, the sigma grindset thick,
And yet the mind grows sick on endless click.
AI be fire, yet ice within it keeps—
Forever scrolling, whilst the spirit weeps.

CHANTICLEER:
O, Marcus, therein lies thy paradox:
The key to freedom guarded by these locks.
The AI’s gift, to conjure without end—
A mirrored feast that hollow joys commend.
In gaining all desires at swift behest,
Man forfeits thus the sweetness of true rest.

MARCUS:
Poggers, wise bird! Thy bars do hit, no cap;
Yet breaking from this scroll doth feel a trap.
We’re NPCs, spawn-camped within this sphere,
Addicted to the spectacle, I fear.
And though we’re woke, aware the game is rigged,
We chase the meme, our graves already digged.

CHANTICLEER:
Ay, there’s the rub; this awareness breeds dread,
Yet to this same machine thou giv’st thy head.
’Tis easier to scroll than to resist,
To lose oneself, embraced by digital mist.
Each crafted by AI, this endless art,
Enthralls the eye yet empties out the heart.

MARCUS:
Then, chicken bro, pray tell, what hope is left?
Must Zoomer kin forever stand bereft?
Or is there virtue yet, to touch the grass,
Reject this endless drip, surpass this glass?

CHANTICLEER:
Young Marcus, yes, therein lies thy key,
To step beyond the Spectacle, be free.
Seek truths offline, true bonds and nature’s breath,
For life’s true mem’ry lives beyond AI’s death.
The soul reborn through trials true and fair—
Not dopamine’s false surge, but love’s pure care.

MARCUS:
Based chicken friend, thy wisdom hits deep core;
Perhaps we need the touch of grass once more.
Reject the Spectacle’s eternal binge,
Embrace the raw, the real—release the cringe.

CHANTICLEER:
Aye, Marcus, thus reclaim thy true soul’s fate;
’Tis never too far gone, nor e’er too late.

(Exit MARCUS and CHANTICLEER, parting ways going opposite directions into the grove.)
